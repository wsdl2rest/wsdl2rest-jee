</big></big>Java User's Migration Path (JUMP) from SOAP to REST with
WSDL2REST <br>
<br>
How feasible is to migrate from SOAP webservices implementation to a
REST implementation by using existing WSDL services definition &amp;
set of service implementations? To see this efforts feasibility this
tool chain&nbsp;would allow quick migration from existing SOAP
webservices implementation to RESTful webservices implementation by
using WSDL definition for the SOAP services already available, together
with the services impl. classes. <br>
<font><br>
</font>WSDL defines detail about the services exposed by SOAP and is
used for discovering these services, wouldn't that enough for us to
know how they should be mapped to a respective RESTful implementation?
There is also an effort underway for defining a standard set of APIs
for RESTful Web Services in java: JSR 311 - JAX-RS.<br>
<br>
Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for
distributed hypermedia systems. Refer Roy
Fielding's [1] for detail on the architectural style. REST
architectural style has been used to guide the design and
development of the architecture for the modern Web. It defines how
resources are defined and addressed.
<br>
<br>
The core abstraction in REST is a remote resource instead of a remote
procedure call.&nbsp; Rather than inventing an
exhaustive list of standards, REST uses existing Internet standards,
including HTTP, XML, and TCP/IP. Instead of every possible
scenario, REST covers the most common problems. <br>
<br>
Uses TCP/IP naming standards to name resources on the Web. Queries and
manipulates those resources with HTTP. Uses standard text-based message
formats like XML or HTML to structure
data<br>
<br>
And well-formed HTML is a subset of XML, satisfying the last REST
requirement<br>
<br>
The most important HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT and DELETE which
CRUD operations should be map to.<br>
<br>
POST&nbsp;&nbsp; - Create, Update, Delete<br>
GET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Read<br>
PUT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Create, Update<br>
DELETE - Delete<br>
<br>
Main characteristics of the REST-stlyle services:<br>
- Request/Response style<br>
- stateless<br>
- cache<br>
- defined resources<br>
- interconnected<br>
- multi-layered<br>
<br>
Consider a service that allows you to get a stock quote with name
<code>StockQuoteService</code>, with operation <code>getStockQuote(String
ticker)</code>. The web service makes available a URL to each ticker
symbols
resource. For an example, here's how a client requests stock quote for
ticker XYZ.<br>
<br>
<code>http://www.stock-example.com/stockquoteservice/StockQuote/XYZ</code><br>
<br>
client would make a HTTP GET request on this URL which would return
following information:<br>
<br>
<code>-Last Price<br>
-Highest trade today<br>
-Lowest trade today<br>
-etc.</code><br>
<br>
in a say XML document like:<br>
<br>
<pre class="codesegment"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br><br>&lt;q:StockQuote xmlns:q="http://www.stock-example.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;<br>    &lt;ticker&gt;XYZ&lt;/ticker&gt;<br>    &lt;last-price currency="USD"&gt;10.32&lt;/last-price&gt;<br>    &lt;highest-trade-today&gt; ... &lt;/highest-trade-today&gt;<br>    &lt;lowest-trade-today&gt;  ... &lt;/lowest-trade-today&gt;<br>    &lt;bid xlink:href="http://www.stock-example.com/stockbidderservice/bid/XYZ"/&gt;<br>&lt;/q:StockQuote&gt;    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</code>
</pre>
<br>
As you could see the retuned XML document has the required infomation
plus a additional continuation infomation for the cleint for the
purpose of say if the client expected make a bid for the recevied
infomation. This XML could be mapped to
a object in an object oriented language such as Java, C#, Ruby, C++ ...
etc. Sor an example in Java this could be
mapped through JAXB (Java Api for Xml Binding). i.e. returned class
could be some what:<br>
<br>
<pre class="codesegment"><code></code>class StockQuote{<br>    String ticker;<br>    String currency;<br>    BigDecimal lastPrice;<br>    BigDecimal highestPriceToday;<br>    BigDecimal lowestPriceToday;<br>    <br>    URL bid;<br>    <br>    ....<br>} </pre>
<br>
<br>
Main point in REST architecture is that we need giving a resource id
for all our entities that need manipulating. As in above example the
resource id is the ticker which combined with
the service endpoint forms a URI. Other points are all calls should be
stateless[1]. The resources should be nouns, not verbs.<br>
<br>
It is important that GET method should not modify any resources
i.e.&nbsp; free of side effects; this maps to readonly operations, if
write operations are required the HTTP POST, PUT or
DELETE should be used.<br>
<br>
Now consider a that we need some past stock quotes data for a given
period to do some analytics. For example consider a method <code>StockQuote[]
getStockQuoteHistory(String ticker, String
fromDate, String toDate)</code>; this could be mapped to a URI like:
(for simplicity for explanation, here the date is given as a string;
but we could have used Date object instead)<br>
<br>
<code>http://www.stock-example.com/stockquoteservice/StockQuoteHistory/XYZ/&lt;fromdate&gt;/&lt;todate&gt;</code><br>
<br>
e.g. if we want the stock quote from 01/01/2008 to 01/31/2008 then the
URI would map to something like this:<br>
<br>
http://www.stock-example.com/stockquoteservice/StockQuoteHistory/XYZ/01012008/01312008<br>
<br>
This is an implisit URI and is not a physical one. It's our service
implementation which interprits meaning of this URI.<br>
<br>

<big><big><br>
2. Mapping SOAP services to RESTful services </big></big>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The approach here explained&nbsp; as one solution for the migration. It
is
request for comments, suggestion etc.<br>
<br>
How do we map SOAP method calls &amp; parameters to resources?<br>
<br>
REST is basically represents resources and operations on those
resources. Where as, SOAP more or less hides real resource behind
exposed service interface.
E.g. A SOAP service method like <code>getArticle(1)</code> could be
maps to <code>GET
/article/1</code> of RESTful service. What if an operation like:<br>
<br>
<code>void setContactDetails(InvokationContext ctx, String firstName,
String
lastName, String description, String addressLine1, String addressLine2,
String city, String state, String zipcode, String
country)</code><br>
<br>
needs mapping to REST style service?<br>
<br>
Here above the <code>InvokationContext </code>is used to send client
eviroment details, context related information etc. Consider an example
of calling above method with following data<br>
<br>
<code>setContactAddress(ctx, &ldquo;John&nbsp; &ldquo;ABC Computing
Systems
Inc,&nbsp; Suite 5A-1204&rdquo;, &ldquo;Orchard Park&ldquo;,
&ldquo;TUCSON&rdquo;, &ldquo;AZ&rdquo;, 85705, USA)</code><br>
<br>
When this is mapped to REST style resources we might define URL
something like:<br>
<code><br>
http://hostname:port/directory-service/ContactAddress/&lt;name(firstname,lastname)&gt;</code><br>
<br>
to store the data we need to POST the data on the above URI. However,
there is couple of problems:<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Based on the above contact address details this URI could grow
large;
As you know some web servers have limitation on the URL size.</li>
  <li>What about <code>InvokationContext</code>, may be we could omit
it for the time
being but, it may also be needed to map, but we cannot determine the
size or the content in it.</li>
</ul>
<br>
One way to reduce the length as this example is to map resources as
abstract: Since we know it is contact address we only provide person
name
instead of all address fields ids.<br>
<br>
Let&rsquo;s say now we need obtaining above person&rsquo;s country of
work from the
directory service above using HTTP GET. Mmm&hellip; how should we issue
the
resource request??<br>
Either we should retrieve the full contact address or we should request
it through a parameter on the URL query string,&nbsp; how ever the
latter option is wrong in REST style webservices.<br>
Ideally there should be another URL like this: <code>http://hostname:port/directory-service/ContactAddress/&lt;name(firstname,lastname)&gt;/country</code>
and issuing a GET on this URL result in the person&rsquo;s country of
work.<br>
<br>
ok now lets say this person has moved and now we need to update his
current location address. This need issuing UPDATE (or POST) HTTP
requests for the person on the following URL.<br>
<br>
<code>http://hostname:port/directory-service/ContactAddress/&lt;name(firstname,lastname)&gt;</code><br>
<br>
Assume that at beginning of this system, directory-service need
provisioning/register users on the system. So the HTTP PUT operation is
issued on the URL<br>
<br>
<code>http://hostname:port/directory-service/&lt;name(firstname,lastname)&gt;<br>
<br>
</code>to provision a particular user on the system by passing user
information something like date of birth.<br>
<br>
Assume as in above example a SOAP based service has been implemented
(see reference sample). If we take the respective WSDL it has following
main components. <br>
<br>
<code>&lt;definitions&gt;<br>
&lt;types&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; definition of types........<br>
&lt;/types&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;message&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; definition of a message....<br>
&lt;/message&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;portType&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; definition of a port.......<br>
&lt;/portType&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;binding&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; definition of a binding....<br>
&lt;/binding&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/definitions&gt;</code><br>
<br>
- WSDL Ports<br>
The &lt;portType&gt; element is the most important WSDL element.<br>
It describes a web service, the operations that can be performed, and
the messages that are involved.<br>
The &lt;portType&gt; element can be compared to a function library (or
a module, or a class) in a traditional programming<br>
language.<br>
<br>
- WSDL Messages<br>
The &lt;message&gt; element defines the data elements of an operation.<br>
Each message can consist of one or more parts. The parts can be
compared to the parameters of a function call in a<br>
traditional programming language.<br>
<br>
- WSDL Types<br>
The &lt;types&gt; element defines the data type that are used by the
web service.<br>
For maximum platform neutrality, WSDL uses XML Schema syntax to define
data types.<br>
<br>
- WSDL Bindings<br>
The &lt;binding&gt; element defines the message format and protocol
details for each port.<br>
<br>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b>Types</b>&ndash; a container for data type
definitions using some type system (such as XSD). </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b>Message</b>&ndash; an abstract, typed
definition
of the data being communicated. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b>Operation</b>&ndash; an abstract description
of an
action supported by the service. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b>Port Type</b>&ndash;an abstract set of
operations
supported by one or more endpoints. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b>Binding</b>&ndash; a concrete protocol and
data
format specification for a particular port type. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b>Port</b>&ndash; a single endpoint defined as
a
combination of a binding and a network address. </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal"><b>Service</b>&ndash; a collection of related
endpoints. </li>
</ul>

2.1 HTTP Defintions<br>
<br>
<small><small>This section describes each HTTP method that applies to
REST-stlyle services. for further infomation about HTTP method please
refer RFC 2616.</small></small><br>
</big></big><br>
<big>GET</big><br>
The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to
a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be
returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the
process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process. <br>
<br>
The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the
request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET
method requests that the entity be transferred only under the
circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The
conditional GET
method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing
cached <br>
entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple requests or
transferring data already held by the client. <br>
<br>
The semantics of the GET method change to a "partial GET" if the
request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests
that only part of the entity be transferred. The partial GET method is
intended to reduce unnecessary
network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be completed
without
transferring data already held by the client. <br>
<br>
The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets the
requirements for HTTP caching reuirements <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">POST </span><br>
The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the
entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed to
allow a uniform method to cover the following functions: <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Annotation of existing resources;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Posting a message to a bulletin board,
newsgroup, mailing list, or similar group of articles;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Providing a block of data, such as the
result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Extending a database through an append
operation.<br>
<br>
The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity
is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate
to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a
newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a
database. <br>
<br>
The action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource
that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either 200 (OK) or 204
(No Content) is the appropriate response status, depending on whether
or not the response includes an entity that describes the result. If a
resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be
201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the
request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header.<br>
<br>
Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response
includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However,
the 303 (See Other) response can be used to direct the user agent to
retrieve a cacheable resource.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PUT </span><br>
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing
resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified
version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI
does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of
being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the
origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a new resource
is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201
(Created) response. If an existing resource is modified, either the 200
(OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate
successful completion of the request. If the resource could not be
created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate error response
SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem. The recipient
of the entity MUST NOT ignore any Content-* (e.g. Content-Range)
headers that it does not understand or implement and MUST return a 501
(Not Implemented) response in such cases. <br>
<br>
If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies
one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated
as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable. <br>
<br>
The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is
reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a
POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed
entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to
some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations. In
contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with
the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server
MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource. If the
server desires that the request be applied to a different URI, it MUST
send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent MAY then make
its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the request. <br>
<br>
A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For
example, an article might have a URI for identifying "the current
version" which is separate from the URI identifying each particular
version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in
several other URIs being defined by the origin server. <br>
<br>
HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an
origin server. Unless otherwise specified for a particular
entity-header, the entity-headers in the PUT request SHOULD be applied
to the resource created or modified by the PUT. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DELETE </span><br>
The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource
identified by the Request-URI. This method MAY be overridden by human
intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot
be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the
status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action
has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT
indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends
to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location. <br>
<br>
A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an
entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not yet
been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted but
the response does not include an entity. <br>
<br>
If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies
one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated
as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable. <br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<big><big><big>3 Resource Classes</big></big></big><br>
A resource class is a Java class that uses JAX-RS annotations&nbsp;to
implement a corresponding Web resource.&nbsp;Resource classes are POJOs
that have at least one method annotated with @Path or a request method
designator. Root resource classes are instantiated by the JAX-RS
runtime and MUST have a public constructor for which the JAX-RS runtime
can provide all parameter values. Note that a zero argument constructor
is permissible&nbsp;under this rule. A public constructor MAY include
parameters annotated with one of the following: @Context,
@Header-Param, @CookieParam, @MatrixParam, @QueryParam or @PathParam.
However, depending on the&nbsp;resource class lifecycle and
concurrency, per-request information may not make sense in a
constructor.<br>
<br>
<h4>3.1 Lifecycle</h4>
By default a new resource class instance is created for each request to
that resource. First the constructor is called, then any requested
dependencies are injected, then the appropriate method is invoked and
finally the object is made available for garbage collection. &nbsp;If
based on an inversion-of-control framework, it may&nbsp;support all of
the lifecycle options provided by that framework.<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
<br>
<big><big><big>4. High Level Approach</big></big></big><br>
<br>
High level approach to the solution is outline below:<br>
<br>
WSDL -&gt; obtain service API &amp; params etc-&gt; map resources
(URLs) &amp; http operations -&gt; user refines mapping -&gt; generate
jsr-311 configuration &amp; classes.<br>
<br>
Wsdl2rest tool generates java binding for the webservices. It creates
java code for services implementation and respective Java code for
server side artifacts. The wsdl2rest current
impl. has mechanism to read WSDL document and generate it&rsquo;s
object
model and emit respective java code for REST mapping.
Since this tool has the way of reading, understanding &amp; creating a
respective wsdl representation, we could use it to
read the WSDL and create us the representation (in memory). There is an
emitter code which you could plug in to generate
output of what you need, from that in memory representation. This
resembles a compiler &amp; a code generator.
Compiler part include parser which could parse WSDL document (including
syntax checking etc), and creating the parsed tree
in memory which could be used for code generation. In this case the
code generator generates java code. What
we could do is replace this code generator to generate required RESTful
services stubs &amp; skeletons implementation
java code. This seems feasible. i.e. replace the java emitter with the
emitter to generate RESTful services stubs. For example&nbsp;generate
code that&nbsp;follows the JSR-311
specification.<br>
<br>
Springframework allows us to define &amp; use webservices very simply
than creating respective tool kit based stubs. So we should plan on
creating a springframework plug in to make use of our
generated classes from the wsdl2REST tool kit. Its proxy based service
definition &amp; invocation model make things
easier by not wanting to understand a particular tool kit
implementation.<br>
