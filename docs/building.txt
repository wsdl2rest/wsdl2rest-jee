Building the source
-------------------
To build the source code you need JDK 1.5 and Apache Ant 1.6 or later version.

You can build the source code from source distribution or from the svn checkout.

The current project is hosted at sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/wsdl2rest 
You can checkout the source read only using following command:

$ svn co http://wsdl2rest.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wsdl2rest <source folder>

To build the code just run ‘ant’ on the top level of source tree.

$ cd <source folder>
$ ant 

To run test just run ‘ant test’


Running wsdl2rest tool
----------------------

To run the wsdl2rest tool for you to convert WSDLs to jsr-311 compliant resources (RESTful service interfaces) do the following:

$ cd <source folder>
$ ant wsdl2rest

or just run

java -cp wsdl2rest-1.0.jar:wsif.jar:wsdl4j-20021124.jar:log4j-1.2.15.jar:commons-logging.jar org.slosc.wsdl2rest.ui.Wsdl2RestForm

e.g. from top of the source tree

$ java -cp ./dist/lib/wsdl2rest-1.0.jar:./lib/wsif.jar:./lib/wsdl4j-20021124.jar:./lib/log4j-1.2.15.jar:./lib/commons-logging.jar org.slosc.wsdl2rest.ui.Wsdl2RestForm


Building and deploying the RESTful webapp
-----------------------------------------
To build the web application for testing RESTful webservice follow below steps:

Approach 1:

Create a jsr-311 complient RESTful service interface and implement your business logic in it. see a sample provided at samples\src\impl\org\slosc\wsdl2rest\samples:

Bookstore.java and BookstoreWithPattern.java

once you finished coding you RESTful service interface, compile it seperatly and you may create a jar file. or you can have all as classes.

build the RESTful app as follows

$ cd <source folder>
$ ant restapp

This will create a web app under ./dist with name 'restapp', you may copy all your classes into it under ./dist/restapp/WEB-INF/classes or have your jar file copied to ./dist/restapp/WEB-INF/lib with all your third party libraries.

deploy the app under Apache Tomcat using following command.

$ cd <source folder>
$ ant test-svr

you can now access you application at http://host:port/restapp


Approach 2:

Create your own web app with jsr-311 complient RESTful service interface and implement your business logic in it. Copy wsdl2rest-1.0.jar (from ./dist/lib folder) and all third party dependents found under ./lib into your web app WEB-INF/lib folder and adding following to web.xml of your web app.
