Some points were discussed on how to implement resource mapper.
Don't break Classname and param name.
Resources list' attribute on all 3 classes.
Getter and setter on all 3 classes.
ResouceMapper will be called from Wsdl2Rest class.
Proper documentation:
We will maintain dicussions.txt in docs folder where all discussions are summarily jotted down.
