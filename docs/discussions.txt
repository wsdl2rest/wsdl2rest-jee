Discussion notes
----------------

09/28/2008
- find a dictionary or implement a partial verb/noun identification mechanism
- use changes done by Thushan ( since last call) to generate 311 classes
- Create final 311 implementation classes
- remove http definition from service level.
- parameter level PathParam usage need to fix
- Thashan to give a feedback on the UI
- Lilantha to Fix WSDL parsing
- Thushan to start the user guide
- Lilantha to complete the design document
- create some sample wsdls and outputs
- Target a release on 10/05/2008 - this should be release candidate 1 if all above things are done.
- Next Plan: 
	- implement jsr 311 server support
	- publish the tool chain to the public domain

Use the first noun as the preferred resource in MetaInfoImpl.
Preferred http method should be POST.
Default mime type should be application/xml (only for class level).
List default mime type in UI (hard code values in ui).
Class resourse should be class name in all lowercase.

-discussed how to handle meta info (http, resource mapping, and mime etc) and decided to refactor ResouceInfo class by 1. renaming it to MetaInfo, 2. add http mapping, 3 mime mapping attributes, to it.
- decided to show http method in a list box, default value to be set to the one which we identify programattically - for an example if the method level resource mapping for updateCustomerAddress(String custId, Address addr) is needed, then the programatic guess for the http mapping is going to be POST (since the method prefix "update") - and show the rest of the http methods (GET, PUT etc) in the list, so that if the programatic guess is incorrect user has the option to change it.
- decided to use a combo box for the resource sugguested. for  an example for updateCustomerAddress(String custId, Address addr) the resouce mapping to be /customer/{custId}/address and /customer/address/{custId} [if updateCustomerAddress(Address addr, String custId) - param order different etc.] this could be edited by the user, given the fact that user is responsible for the change. i.e. if user makes invalid mapping it is users whole responsibility.
- Thushan to send a UI sketch.

08/03/2008
- Discussed to add additional fields into ResourceInfo class to hold http method & verbs; this need to align with the jsr-311 final draft.
  [Thushan suggested to use a ResourceMapper instance in ResourceInfo instead of a field to hols above, which Thushan could evaluate and see if that's a good approach]
- Thushan will send a UI sketch (mockup) to dicuss (on next week meeting :-))
- Lilantha to work on the jsr-311 code generator
- Discussed to add some wsdl samples suitable for initial works that having good verbs to be mapped in resources identifacation.
- Start implementation according to the jsr-311 final draft.



7/20/2008
Some points were discussed on how to implement resource mapper.
Don't break Classname and param name.
Resources list' attribute on all 3 classes.
Getter and setter on all 3 classes.
ResouceMapper will be called from Wsdl2Rest class.
Proper documentation:
We will maintain dicussions.txt in docs folder where all discussions are summarily jotted down.
